  "aboutMe": "I’m Hévelin, a front-end developer passionate about creating engaging and functional user interfaces. I'm a 24 years old with a background in mechanical engineering and a career shift to web development. My career goal is to specialize in modern frameworks like React and Next.js while contributing to building digital solutions that positively impact user experiences.",
  "hobbies": "I'm very eclectic and always looking for new experiences. My soundtrack varies a lot, from pop to metal, indie and MPB, always accompanying every moment of my day. I'm always listening to music, whether I'm programming, reading or exercising. I'm also passionate about documentaries, especially about the seabed. I can't resist learning more about the wonders of the ocean (the whale shark, with all its tranquility, is my favorite animal). I like to explore the world around me with an open mind, whether it's discovering new music, watching fascinating documentaries or just enjoying what life has to offer.",
  "motivation": "My motivation to join the Código Certo Coders community comes from my desire to continuously learn and collaborate with people who share the same passion for technology and innovation. I see the community as an opportunity to grow as a developer, exchange knowledge, and contribute to projects that can positively impact the world."
